# Sarah Kitchen Portfolio
## Overview
This repository contains the HTML5 and CSS3 code used to create a portfolio website. This website showcases my basic information, personal projects and how to contact me. 
## GUI/Interface
To adapt for different view ports I used the following dimensions:
  - Desktop:
      - minimum width: 960pixels
      - common minimum desktop width
  - Tablet:
      - between 481pixels and 959pixels
      - size of most tablets
   - Phones:
       - 480px or smaller
       - ensures quality display on even smaller screens
I also used percentages, fixed values, absolute values, and various position choices in my stylesheets to create fully responsive pages which are able to adapt when screen sizes change while maintaining readability and design. 
### Linear Gradients and Colour Scheme
I combined top to bottom and angle linear gradients to create my background on all pages. The grid design was adapted from Stephen Judis https://www.stefanjudis.com/blog/a-css-based-background-grid-generator/. 

I used a colour scheme featuring dark and light greens to provide a nice contrast between the background and text. I also utilized the translucent feature to add more depth to my boxes.
My colour scheme: #071b14, #07130b, #04110a, #a8e9bd, #23ff6b
